Question 1:
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Hints: 
Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

---------------
'''
for i in range(2000,3201):
    if i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
        print("numbers divisible by 7: ",i)
'''

test=[i for i in range(2000,3201) if i%7==0 if i%5!=0]
print(test)
----------------

Question2:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be:
40320
Hints:In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

-------------
i=int(input("enter a number: "))
fact=1
for x in range(1,i+1):
    fact=fact*x

print("factorial of",i,"is: ",fact)
------------------

Question 3:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
Consider use dict()

-----------------
n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
dict={}
for i in range(1,n+1):
    key=i
    value=i*i
    dict[key]=value
print(dict)
----------------------


Question 4:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be: 1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.
Hints:In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

---------------------
'''
#n=int(input("Enter a number: "))
for i in range(100,201):
    for j in i:
        if i[j]%2==0:
            j++
    print(i)
'''

def binary():
    binaries=[i for i in input("Enter 4-digit binary numbers: ").split()]
    print("Binaries entered: ",binaries)
    for i in binaries:
        x=int(i,2)
        if x%5==0:
            print("Number divisble by 5: ",i)
        else:
            print("None divisible")


def main():
    binary()


if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
--------------------

Question 5:
Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 (both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

------------------------
def sequence():
    for i in range(100,301):
        x=str(i)
        for i in range(len(x)):
            n=int(x[i])
            if n%2!=0:
                break
        else:
            print(x,end=',')


def main():
    sequence()

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
----------------------------


Question6:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3
Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

----------------------
def count():
    string=input("enter a string: ")
    letters=0
    digits=0
    others=0
    for i in string:
        if i.isalpha():
            letters=letters+1
        elif i.isdigit():
            digits=digits+1
        else:
            others=others+1

    print("Total letters: ",letters)
    print("Total digits: ",digits)
    print("Others: ",others)



def main():
    count()

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
